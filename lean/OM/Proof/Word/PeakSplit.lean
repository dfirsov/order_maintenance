# Theorem W, option (A), stage A2: the peak of a split start (`splitChunkStartS`)

The locals at width `K`, except the new tags `ty`, `tz` (`tx − f1` plus a room label) at `K + 1`
(`ΓS`).

* `iaPrep_pk`: the labels and tags of the two new chunks (`roomCall_pk`).
* `childS_pk`: the second new child at position `r + 2`, with `r ≤ lcap children` (`findCall_le`).
* `insertAround_pkok`: the two tags written by `guardedSetTag`, bounded by the split's end state
  (`gstCall_pk`); the second call writes the tag only at `z ≠ y` (`gstCall_frame`).
* `split_pkok`: the split start; the new chunks `y ≠ z` from the push semantics.

Nothing here is used by Theorems A and B.

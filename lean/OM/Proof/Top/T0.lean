# M5: Lemma T0 (the partition of a drain)

`startDrain` cuts the children's weights `ws` (total `S`) greedily at half, moves the cut right
past a pair of targets it would separate, and back if that reaches the end (`cutLen`, `shiftR`,
`shiftL`). With every unit (a child, or the two targets of a running drain) of weight at most `U`,
both parts weigh at most `⌊S/2⌋ + U` (`docs/PROOF.md` §4.5.2).

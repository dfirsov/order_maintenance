# Theorem W, option (A), stage A2: the cut of a drain, its side list, and its end

* `drainCut_pk`: the weight sum `t` of at most 511 children (width `K + 9`), the cut count `c`
  (at most the loop index) and the shift `k` (below the children count by its guard).
* `drainSide_pk`, `finishDrain_pk`: safe, but for the filters of `finishDrain` (`filter_pk`).

Nothing here is used by Theorems A and B.
